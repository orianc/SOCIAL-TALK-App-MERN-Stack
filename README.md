## Current issue :

_Currently stuck on react build deployment. React router doesn't work in prod._

- [1. Install](#1-install)
  - [1.1. Client](#11-client)
  - [1.2. Server](#12-server)

# 1. Install

## 1.1. Client

From bash `socialtalk-complete` :

```bash
cd client
npm i
npm start
```

**If react-script error :**

```bash
npm install react-scripts --save
```

## 1.2. Server

open a a new bash in `socialtalk-complete` and run :

```bash
cd server
npm i
npm start
```

After install complete and working you can run the project from original path `socialtalk-complete` with :

in one bash

```bash
npm run start-client
```

in a second bash

```bash
npm run start-client
```

**When the `react build` will be valid, only server bash will be required and it's will be wrapped in a cordova application.**
